# Smoke.net
In-progress ML library for C Sharp. The goal of this project is to develop a native ML library for C# in .net Core. Currently there is not much support for ML in .net Core

INSPIRATION: One of my other projects, SilentAssistant, requires a fast and accessible native C# ML solution. There is currently nothing on the market that satisfies my needs, so I am trying to build a ML library for this myself.

The first step of this project is to allow a developer to train and deploy an LSTM or Linear Neural Network in .net Core
